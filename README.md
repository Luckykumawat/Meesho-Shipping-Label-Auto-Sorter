# Meesho-Shipping-Label-Auto-Sorter
This script automatically reads, detects, and rearranges Meesho shipping labels based on their carrier partners using OCR. It works for PDFs containing multiple labels, extracts text from each page, identifies the courier partner, and sorts the pages into a clean, ordered PDF.
